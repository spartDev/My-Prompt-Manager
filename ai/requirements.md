# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Chrome extension that allows users to save, organize, and manage a personal library of prompts. The extension will provide an easy way to store frequently used prompts, categorize them, and quickly access them when needed across different web applications and AI tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save prompts to my personal library, so that I can reuse them later without having to retype or remember them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the extension icon THEN the system SHALL display a popup interface
2. WHEN the user enters a prompt text in the save form THEN the system SHALL validate the input is not empty
3. WHEN the user clicks save THEN the system SHALL store the prompt in local storage
4. WHEN the user provides a title for the prompt THEN the system SHALL save it with the custom title
5. IF no title is provided THEN the system SHALL generate a title from the first 50 characters of the prompt

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to organize my prompts into categories, so that I can easily find specific types of prompts when I need them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving a prompt THEN the system SHALL allow the user to assign it to a category
2. WHEN the user creates a new category THEN the system SHALL add it to the available categories list
3. WHEN viewing the prompt library THEN the system SHALL display prompts grouped by category
4. IF no category is assigned THEN the system SHALL place the prompt in an "Uncategorized" section
5. WHEN the user selects a category filter THEN the system SHALL show only prompts from that category

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to quickly copy prompts from my library, so that I can paste them into text fields on any website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a saved prompt THEN the system SHALL copy it to the clipboard
2. WHEN a prompt is copied THEN the system SHALL show a visual confirmation message
3. WHEN the user hovers over a prompt THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the full text
4. WHEN the prompt text is longer than the display area THEN the system SHALL show a truncated version with ellipsis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit and delete prompts from my library, so that I can keep my collection up-to-date and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user right-clicks on a prompt THEN the system SHALL show edit and delete options
2. WHEN the user selects edit THEN the system SHALL open an editable form with the current prompt data
3. WHEN the user saves edits THEN the system SHALL update the stored prompt with new information
4. WHEN the user selects delete THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog
5. WHEN deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL remove the prompt from storage permanently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search through my prompt library, so that I can quickly find specific prompts even when I have many saved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL filter prompts in real-time
2. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL match against prompt titles and content
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text
4. WHEN the search box is cleared THEN the system SHALL show all prompts again
5. IF no prompts match the search THEN the system SHALL display a "no results found" message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my prompt library to be available across all my Chrome browser sessions, so that I don't lose my data when I restart my browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompts are saved THEN the system SHALL persist them using Chrome's storage API
2. WHEN the browser is restarted THEN the system SHALL load all previously saved prompts
3. WHEN the extension is updated THEN the system SHALL preserve existing prompt data
4. WHEN storage quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL notify the user and prevent new saves
5. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery or show an error message
