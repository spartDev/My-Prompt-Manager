# Prompt Usage Analytics - Specification Summary

## Status: ✅ Production-Ready

All three specification documents have been updated and are now fully aligned with technical research and design decisions.

---

## Updated Files

### 1. **requirements.md** ✅
**Changes:** Minor updates only
- Added CSV export format support (Requirement 7)
- Added specific acceptance criteria for CSV vs JSON export
- All user stories remain intact and valid

**Status:** Ready for implementation

---

### 2. **design.md** ✅
**Changes:** Major comprehensive updates

**New Sections Added:**
- ✅ Storage Architecture Decision (chrome.storage.local with 3-tier aggregation)
- ✅ Chart Library Selection (Lightweight Charts, uPlot, Chart.js)
- ✅ UX Pattern Specifications (time ranges, empty states, privacy badges, number formatting)
- ✅ Export/Import Specification (CSV + JSON formats)
- ✅ Enhanced Service Layer (batching, caching, incremental aggregation)
- ✅ Quota Management Strategy (monitoring, auto-cleanup, thresholds)
- ✅ Performance Targets (specific benchmarks for all operations)
- ✅ Enhanced Testing Strategy (quota tests, performance benchmarks, migration tests)

**Key Technical Decisions Documented:**
- Storage: chrome.storage.local (not IndexedDB)
- Charts: ~83 KB bundle impact (Lightweight Charts + uPlot + Chart.js)
- Retention: Raw events (1000 max), Hourly (30d), Daily (365d)
- Performance: < 500ms dashboard load, < 200ms aggregation
- Migration threshold: Switch to IndexedDB if > 8 MB storage

**Status:** Production-ready, all decisions justified

---

### 3. **tasks.md** ✅
**Changes:** Complete rewrite with specific implementation steps

**Before:** 15 generic tasks
**After:** 8 phases, 40+ detailed tasks with specific acceptance criteria

**New Structure:**
- Phase 1: Foundation & Data Models (2-3 days)
- Phase 2: Storage Layer (3-4 days)
- Phase 3: Analytics Tracker Service (2-3 days)
- Phase 4: Analytics Processor Service (3-4 days)
- Phase 5: UI Components (4-5 days)
- Phase 6: Data Management (2-3 days)
- Phase 7: Testing & Optimization (2-3 days)
- Phase 8: Polish & Documentation (1-2 days)

**Each Task Now Includes:**
- Specific file paths (`src/services/AnalyticsTracker.ts`)
- Exact method signatures and parameters
- Performance targets (< 5ms, < 50ms, < 100ms, etc.)
- Acceptance criteria (measurable, testable)
- Requirement traceability
- Concrete implementation details

**Status:** Ready for development, no ambiguity

---

## Key Metrics

### Time Estimate
- **Total:** 16-20 days (3-4 weeks)
- **Critical path:** Storage Layer → Tracker → Processor → UI

### Bundle Size Impact
- **Chart libraries:** ~83 KB total
  - Lightweight Charts: 35 KB
  - uPlot: 48 KB
  - Chart.js (tree-shaken): ~50-70 KB (pie charts only)

### Storage Usage
- **Typical:** ~240 KB (1,000 events with aggregates)
- **Maximum:** < 5 MB (10,000 events)
- **Quota:** 10 MB available (2.4% typical usage)

### Performance Targets
```
Event capture:        < 5ms overhead
Batch write:          < 50ms (100 events)
Incremental agg:      < 100ms (100 new events)
Stats computation:    < 200ms (365 days)
Dashboard load:       < 500ms
Chart render:         < 300ms
Interactive update:   < 100ms
Storage quota check:  < 10ms
```

## Development Order

**Recommended sequence:**

1. **Week 1:** Foundation + Storage
   - Phase 1: Types and chart library setup (2-3 days)
   - Phase 2: Storage architecture (3-4 days)

2. **Week 2:** Services
   - Phase 3: Analytics tracker (2-3 days)
   - Phase 4: Analytics processor (3-4 days)

3. **Week 3:** UI + Data Management
   - Phase 5: Dashboard and components (4-5 days)
   - Phase 6: Export/import/clear (2-3 days)

4. **Week 4:** Testing + Polish
   - Phase 7: Comprehensive testing (2-3 days)
   - Phase 8: Documentation and release (1-2 days)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Storage architecture (chrome.storage.local well-understood)
- Chart libraries (all CSP compliant, proven in extensions)
- Type definitions (straightforward TypeScript)
- UI components (standard React patterns)

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Performance targets (may need optimization)
- Circular buffer implementation (edge cases)
- Cross-context communication (content script ↔ background)
- Storage quota management (testing at scale)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Early performance benchmarking (Phase 7)
- Comprehensive unit tests (90%+ coverage target)
- Integration tests for cross-context flows
- Storage quota testing with synthetic data
