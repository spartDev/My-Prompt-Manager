# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Prompt Usage Analytics feature will provide users with insights into how they use their prompt library within the My Prompt Manager Chrome extension. This feature will track prompt usage patterns, frequency, and effectiveness to help users optimize their prompt management and identify their most valuable prompts. The analytics will be stored locally and provide actionable insights through visual dashboards and reports.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a prompt library user, I want to see which prompts I use most frequently, so that I can identify my most valuable prompts and organize them better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inserts a prompt into any AI platform THEN the system SHALL record the usage event with timestamp, prompt ID, and platform information
2. WHEN a user accesses the analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a list of prompts ranked by usage frequency
3. WHEN viewing prompt usage statistics THEN the system SHALL show usage count, last used date, and usage trend for each prompt
4. IF a prompt has been used more than 10 times THEN the system SHALL mark it as a "frequently used" prompt

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a prompt manager user, I want to see usage patterns over time, so that I can understand how my prompt usage habits change and identify seasonal or project-based patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL display usage trends over the last 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year
2. WHEN displaying time-based analytics THEN the system SHALL show daily, weekly, and monthly usage aggregations
3. WHEN a user selects a specific time period THEN the system SHALL filter all analytics data to that timeframe
4. IF no usage data exists for a selected period THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user working across multiple AI platforms, I want to see which platforms I use most with my prompts, so that I can understand my workflow patterns and optimize my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prompt is used on any supported platform THEN the system SHALL record the platform identifier (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.)
2. WHEN viewing platform analytics THEN the system SHALL display usage breakdown by platform with percentages
3. WHEN a user clicks on a platform in the analytics THEN the system SHALL show detailed usage for that specific platform
4. IF a custom site is configured THEN the system SHALL track and display usage for custom sites separately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a prompt library organizer, I want to see which categories are used most, so that I can restructure my prompt organization for better efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompts are used THEN the system SHALL track usage by category
2. WHEN viewing category analytics THEN the system SHALL display usage statistics for each category
3. WHEN a category has no recent usage THEN the system SHALL highlight it as potentially unused
4. IF a user renames or deletes a category THEN the system SHALL maintain historical usage data with the original category name

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want all analytics data to be stored locally, so that my usage patterns remain private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN usage events are recorded THEN the system SHALL store all data using Chrome's local storage API
2. WHEN analytics data is processed THEN the system SHALL perform all calculations locally without external API calls
3. WHEN a user uninstalls the extension THEN the system SHALL ensure all analytics data is removed with the extension
4. IF storage quota is approaching limits THEN the system SHALL provide options to archive or delete old analytics data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who wants to maintain my privacy, I want to be able to clear my usage analytics, so that I can reset my tracking data when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses analytics settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to clear analytics data
2. WHEN a user chooses to clear analytics THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation dialog with clear consequences
3. WHEN analytics data is cleared THEN the system SHALL remove all usage tracking data while preserving prompts and categories
4. IF partial clearing is requested THEN the system SHALL allow clearing data for specific time periods or platforms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user who values my prompt library, I want to export my usage analytics, so that I can backup my insights or analyze them externally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests analytics export THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV or JSON file with all usage data
2. WHEN exporting analytics THEN the system SHALL include metadata about export date and data range
3. WHEN the export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide download functionality for the analytics file
4. IF the analytics data is large THEN the system SHALL provide progress indication during export
5. WHEN a user selects CSV format THEN the system SHALL generate an Excel-compatible CSV file for easy analysis
6. WHEN a user selects JSON format THEN the system SHALL include complete analytics data with full type information
