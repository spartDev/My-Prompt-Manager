![Before screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/...)

### After
![After screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/...)
```

**Multi-Device Format:**
```markdown
| Desktop (1920x1080) | Tablet (768x1024) | Mobile (375x667) |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| ![Desktop](url1) | ![Tablet](url2) | ![Mobile](url3) |
```

### 4.3 GIF/Video Best Practices

**Tools Recommended:**
- **Recordit** - Quick GIF recording (Mac/Windows)
- **LICEcap** - Open-source GIF recorder
- **Kap** - macOS screen recorder
- **ScreenToGif** - Windows GIF recorder
- **Peek** - Linux GIF recorder

**Guidelines:**
- **Duration:** 5-15 seconds ideal
- **File Size:** Keep under 10 MB (use compression)
- **Frame Rate:** 15-24 fps (balance quality/size)
- **Resolution:** 1280x720 or smaller
- **Focus:** Show specific interaction, not entire screen

**Example Usage:**
```markdown
## Demo

### User Workflow
![Feature demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/user/demo.gif)

**Steps shown:**
1. User clicks "Add Prompt" button
2. Modal opens with form
3. User fills in title and content
4. Saves successfully with confirmation
```

### 4.4 Diagrams and Architecture

**Mermaid.js (Native GitHub Support):**

```markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Action] --> B[Service Layer]
    B --> C[Storage Manager]
    C --> D[Chrome Storage API]
    B --> E[UI Update]
```
```

**Other Options:**
- **Excalidraw** - Hand-drawn style diagrams
- **Draw.io** - Professional diagrams
- **Lucidchart** - Enterprise diagramming

### 4.5 Image Hosting

**Recommended:**
1. **GitHub's Native Upload** - Drag & drop into PR description
   - Automatically hosted on GitHub's CDN
   - Format: `https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/...`
   - No expiration, best reliability

2. **Repository Assets** - For permanent documentation
   - Store in `docs/images/` or `.github/assets/`
   - Reference: `![Alt](./docs/images/screenshot.png)`

**Avoid:**
- Imgur, Dropbox (external dependencies)
- Personal cloud storage (access control issues)
- Temporary file sharing services (links expire)

## 8. Automation & Validation

### 8.1 GitHub Actions for PR Validation

**Check PR Description Length:**
```yaml
name: PR Description Check
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited]

jobs:
  check-description:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check PR Description
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            const body = context.payload.pull_request.body || '';
            if (body.length < 50) {
              core.setFailed('PR description must be at least 50 characters');
            }
```

**Verify Checklist Completion:**
```yaml
name: Checklist Verification
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize]

jobs:
  verify-checklist:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Verify Checklist
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            const body = context.payload.pull_request.body || '';
            const checkboxes = body.match(/- \[[ x]\]/g) || [];
            const checked = body.match(/- \[x\]/g) || [];

            if (checkboxes.length === 0) {
              core.setFailed('PR must include checklist items');
            }

            const percentComplete = (checked.length / checkboxes.length) * 100;
            console.log(`Checklist ${percentComplete}% complete`);

            if (percentComplete < 80) {
              core.setFailed('At least 80% of checklist items must be checked');
            }
```

**Require Issue Link:**
```yaml
name: Require Issue Link
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited]

jobs:
  check-issue-link:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check for Issue Reference
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            const body = context.payload.pull_request.body || '';
            const title = context.payload.pull_request.title || '';

            // Check for #issue, PROJ-123, or URL
            const hasIssueRef = /#\d+|[A-Z]+-\d+|github\.com.*issues|atlassian\.net.*browse/.test(body + title);

            if (!hasIssueRef) {
              core.setFailed('PR must reference an issue (GitHub #issue or JIRA ticket)');
            }
```

### 8.2 PR Template Linting

**Using `danger.js`:**
```javascript
// dangerfile.js
import { danger, warn, fail } from 'danger';

const pr = danger.github.pr;
const body = pr.body || '';

// Check PR size
const changes = danger.github.pr.additions + danger.github.pr.deletions;
if (changes > 500) {
  warn(`This PR is quite large (${changes} lines). Consider splitting it.`);
}
