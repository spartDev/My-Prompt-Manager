# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to share individual prompts with other users through encoded strings, similar to the existing custom site configuration sharing mechanism. Users can generate shareable encoded strings from their prompt cards and import shared prompts from others, facilitating community collaboration and prompt distribution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a prompt library user, I want to share my prompts with other users via encoded strings, so that I can easily distribute useful prompts to my colleagues or community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a prompt card THEN the system SHALL display a share icon button
2. WHEN a user clicks the share icon button THEN the system SHALL generate an encoded string representation of the prompt
3. WHEN the encoded string is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically copy it to the user's clipboard
4. WHEN the copy operation completes THEN the system SHALL show a success toast notification
5. IF the copy operation fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message with fallback options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a prompt library user, I want to import shared prompts from encoded strings, so that I can easily add prompts shared by others to my library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the add prompt interface THEN the system SHALL provide two options: "Create New Prompt" and "Import Shared Prompt"
2. WHEN a user selects "Import Shared Prompt" THEN the system SHALL display a text input field for the encoded string
3. WHEN a user pastes a valid encoded string THEN the system SHALL decode and preview the prompt details
4. WHEN a user confirms the import THEN the system SHALL add the prompt to their library with proper validation
5. IF the encoded string is invalid THEN the system SHALL show a clear error message explaining the issue
6. WHEN importing a prompt THEN the system SHALL allow the user to modify the category before saving

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a prompt library user, I want the shared prompt encoding to be secure and reliable, so that I can trust the integrity of shared prompts and my data remains safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encoding a prompt THEN the system SHALL use the same secure encoding mechanism as custom site configurations
2. WHEN decoding a shared prompt THEN the system SHALL validate all data fields before processing
3. WHEN decoding fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without affecting existing prompts
4. WHEN importing a prompt THEN the system SHALL sanitize all text content to prevent XSS attacks
5. WHEN encoding a prompt THEN the system SHALL only include necessary prompt data (title, content, category)
6. WHEN decoding a prompt THEN the system SHALL assign a new unique ID to prevent conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a prompt library user, I want the sharing interface to be intuitive and accessible, so that I can easily share and import prompts without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a prompt card THEN the share icon SHALL be visually consistent with other action buttons
2. WHEN hovering over the share icon THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip explaining the action
3. WHEN the share operation completes THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about what was copied
4. WHEN importing a prompt THEN the system SHALL show a preview of the prompt before final confirmation
5. WHEN the import interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for both creation and import options
6. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all sharing and import controls SHALL be accessible via keyboard

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a prompt library user, I want shared prompts to integrate seamlessly with my existing library, so that imported prompts work exactly like my own prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prompt is imported THEN the system SHALL treat it identically to user-created prompts
2. WHEN importing a prompt THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to existing or new categories
3. WHEN a shared prompt is imported THEN the system SHALL validate it against existing prompt validation rules
4. WHEN importing a prompt with a non-existent category THEN the system SHALL offer to create the category or assign to an existing one
5. WHEN a prompt is imported successfully THEN the system SHALL update the prompt count and category displays
6. WHEN importing a prompt THEN the system SHALL respect storage quota limits and warn if approaching capacity
