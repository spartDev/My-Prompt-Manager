# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user notification system that informs users when the Chrome extension has been updated to a new version. The system leverages Chrome's native notification APIs and provides multiple touchpoints to ensure users are aware of updates and new features. The notification system will enhance user engagement by highlighting improvements and encouraging continued usage of the extension.

## Requirements
