# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds support for Le Chat by Mistral (https://chat.mistral.ai/chat) as a new AI platform in the My Prompt Manager Chrome extension. The integration will allow users to access their prompt library directly within the Mistral chat interface, providing seamless prompt insertion capabilities similar to existing Claude, ChatGPT, and Perplexity integrations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of Le Chat by Mistral, I want to access my prompt library directly within the chat interface, so that I can quickly insert saved prompts without switching between tabs or applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits chat.mistral.ai/chat THEN the system SHALL detect the Mistral platform and initialize the appropriate strategy
2. WHEN the Mistral chat interface loads THEN the system SHALL inject a "My Prompts" button in an appropriate location within the UI
3. WHEN the user clicks the "My Prompts" button THEN the system SHALL open the prompt library interface
4. WHEN the user selects a prompt from the library THEN the system SHALL insert the prompt text into the Mistral chat input field
5. WHEN the prompt is inserted THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate events to ensure Mistral recognizes the input change

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Mistral integration to follow the same visual and interaction patterns as other AI platform integrations, so that I have a consistent experience across all supported platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "My Prompts" button is displayed THEN it SHALL use Mistral-appropriate styling that matches the platform's design language
2. WHEN the button is hovered or focused THEN it SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback consistent with Mistral's UI patterns
3. WHEN the prompt library opens THEN it SHALL display the same interface and functionality as other platform integrations
4. WHEN prompts are inserted THEN the insertion SHALL be seamless and not disrupt the user's workflow
5. WHEN the integration encounters errors THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Mistral integration to follow the established architecture patterns, so that it is maintainable and extensible within the existing codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the Mistral strategy THEN it SHALL extend the PlatformStrategy base class
2. WHEN the strategy is created THEN it SHALL implement all required methods: getInsertionPoint(), createPromptIcon(), insertPrompt()
3. WHEN the strategy is registered THEN it SHALL be added to the PlatformManager with appropriate priority
4. WHEN the UI factory creates Mistral icons THEN it SHALL follow the same security and DOM construction patterns as existing implementations
5. WHEN the strategy handles DOM insertion THEN it SHALL use DOMPurify for content sanitization and follow CSP-compliant practices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Mistral integration to work reliably with different input methods and scenarios, so that I can depend on it for my daily workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Mistral uses different input field types (textarea, contenteditable, etc.) THEN the system SHALL detect and handle each type appropriately
2. WHEN Mistral's DOM structure changes due to updates THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms to maintain functionality
3. WHEN the user navigates between different chat conversations THEN the integration SHALL continue to work correctly
4. WHEN multiple insertion methods are available THEN the system SHALL try them in order of reliability until one succeeds
5. WHEN insertion fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate debug information and attempt fallback methods

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Mistral integration to be performant and not impact the chat interface's responsiveness, so that my chat experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the strategy initializes THEN it SHALL complete within reasonable time limits without blocking the UI
2. WHEN detecting input elements THEN it SHALL use efficient DOM queries and avoid excessive polling
3. WHEN inserting prompts THEN it SHALL complete the operation quickly without noticeable delays
4. WHEN the integration is not needed THEN it SHALL have minimal impact on page performance
5. WHEN cleaning up resources THEN it SHALL properly remove event listeners and DOM modifications
