# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing backup and restore functionality in My Prompt Manager with improved security, user experience, and category management capabilities. Currently, the extension supports basic import/export of prompts and categories, but lacks color support for categories and robust security measures for backup files. This enhancement will add category color customization, strengthen backup file security with encryption, improve the user interface for backup/restore operations, and provide better error handling and validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user organizing my prompts, I want to assign colors to my categories, so that I can visually distinguish between different types of prompts and improve my workflow organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new category THEN the system SHALL provide a color picker interface with predefined color options
2. WHEN I edit an existing category THEN the system SHALL allow me to change the assigned color
3. WHEN I view categories in the filter dropdown THEN the system SHALL display each category with its assigned color indicator
4. WHEN I view prompt cards THEN the system SHALL display the category color as a visual indicator on each card
5. WHEN no color is assigned to a category THEN the system SHALL use a default neutral color
6. WHEN I select a category color THEN the system SHALL persist the color choice in storage
7. WHEN displaying categories THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility compliance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my backup files to be encrypted, so that my sensitive prompts are protected if the backup file is accessed by unauthorized parties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a backup THEN the system SHALL prompt me to set an optional encryption password
2. WHEN I provide an encryption password THEN the system SHALL encrypt the backup data using AES-256 encryption
3. WHEN I create an encrypted backup THEN the system SHALL generate a secure salt and store it with the encrypted data
4. WHEN I restore from an encrypted backup THEN the system SHALL prompt me for the decryption password
5. IF I provide an incorrect decryption password THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
6. WHEN I choose not to encrypt a backup THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the backup is unencrypted
7. WHEN encryption fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and not create a corrupted backup file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user managing my prompt library, I want an improved backup and restore interface, so that I can easily understand the process and manage my data with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access backup functionality THEN the system SHALL display a dedicated backup/restore section in settings
2. WHEN I create a backup THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator and estimated completion time
3. WHEN I create a backup THEN the system SHALL display backup metadata including creation date, prompt count, and category count
4. WHEN I view available backups THEN the system SHALL show a list of recent backup files with their metadata
5. WHEN I restore from a backup THEN the system SHALL show a preview of what will be imported before confirmation
6. WHEN I restore from a backup THEN the system SHALL provide options to merge with existing data or replace all data
7. WHEN backup/restore operations complete THEN the system SHALL display clear success messages with action summaries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user restoring from a backup, I want to preview and selectively restore content, so that I can maintain control over my prompt library and avoid unwanted changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a backup file for restore THEN the system SHALL display a preview showing categories and prompt counts
2. WHEN viewing the restore preview THEN the system SHALL allow me to select which categories to restore
3. WHEN viewing the restore preview THEN the system SHALL show conflicts with existing categories and prompts
4. WHEN I confirm a selective restore THEN the system SHALL only import the selected categories and their prompts
5. IF there are naming conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide options to rename, skip, or overwrite conflicting items
6. WHEN I choose to merge data THEN the system SHALL preserve existing prompts and add new ones from the backup
7. WHEN I choose to replace data THEN the system SHALL warn me about data loss and require explicit confirmation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user working with backup files, I want robust error handling and validation, so that I can trust the backup/restore process and recover from issues gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a backup file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and integrity before processing
2. IF a backup file is corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL display a detailed error message explaining the issue
3. WHEN a restore operation fails THEN the system SHALL rollback any partial changes and restore the previous state
4. WHEN I import a backup from an older version THEN the system SHALL handle version compatibility and migrate data formats
5. IF storage quota is exceeded during restore THEN the system SHALL warn me and provide options to free up space
6. WHEN network issues occur during backup/restore THEN the system SHALL provide retry options and offline capabilities
7. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user sharing prompts across devices, I want automatic backup suggestions and cloud storage integration options, so that I can keep my prompt library synchronized and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have made significant changes to my prompt library THEN the system SHALL suggest creating a backup
2. WHEN I haven't created a backup in a configurable time period THEN the system SHALL display a reminder notification
3. WHEN I create a backup THEN the system SHALL offer to save it to cloud storage services (Google Drive, Dropbox)
4. WHEN I enable automatic backups THEN the system SHALL create scheduled backups based on my preferences
5. WHEN I access the extension on a new device THEN the system SHALL offer to restore from available cloud backups
6. WHEN cloud storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to local backup options
7. WHEN I disable automatic backups THEN the system SHALL respect my choice and not create unsolicited backups

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user concerned about data privacy, I want transparency about what data is included in backups and control over sensitive information, so that I can make informed decisions about my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a backup THEN the system SHALL clearly display what data types will be included
2. WHEN I create a backup THEN the system SHALL provide options to exclude sensitive categories or prompts
3. WHEN I view backup contents THEN the system SHALL show data categories without exposing actual prompt content
4. WHEN I share a backup file THEN the system SHALL warn me about potential privacy implications
5. IF I have marked prompts as private THEN the system SHALL ask whether to include them in backups
6. WHEN I export data THEN the system SHALL provide options for different privacy levels (full, partial, public-only)
7. WHEN I delete the extension THEN the system SHALL offer to create a final backup before data removal
