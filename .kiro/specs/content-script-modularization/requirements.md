# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current content script (src/content.js) is a monolithic JavaScript file containing over 4900 lines of code with multiple classes, utilities, and platform-specific logic all in one file. This creates maintainability issues, makes testing difficult, and doesn't leverage TypeScript's benefits. The goal is to split this into modular TypeScript files that are better organized, maintainable, and testable while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the content script to be split into modular TypeScript files, so that the codebase is more maintainable and easier to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the content script is refactored THEN it SHALL be split into separate TypeScript files based on logical functionality
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN each TypeScript file SHALL have a single responsibility and clear purpose
3. WHEN the modular structure is implemented THEN the original content.js file SHALL be replaced with a main entry point that imports and orchestrates the modules
4. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN all classes and functions SHALL have proper type definitions and interfaces

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper separation of concerns between different functionalities, so that each module can be developed and tested independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classes are extracted THEN each class SHALL be in its own TypeScript file with appropriate exports
2. WHEN utilities are separated THEN they SHALL be grouped by functionality (logging, DOM manipulation, storage, etc.)
3. WHEN platform strategies are modularized THEN each strategy SHALL be in its own file extending the base strategy interface
4. WHEN the CSS injection is separated THEN it SHALL be in its own module with proper typing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing functionality to be preserved during the modularization, so that the extension continues to work exactly as before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL work identically to the original implementation
2. WHEN the modular version is loaded THEN it SHALL inject icons and handle prompt insertion exactly as the original
3. WHEN platform-specific behaviors are tested THEN they SHALL work identically across Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and custom sites
4. WHEN keyboard navigation is tested THEN it SHALL function exactly as in the original implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript types and interfaces, so that the code is type-safe and has better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL cover all data structures used in the content script
2. WHEN classes are converted THEN they SHALL have proper type annotations for all methods and properties
3. WHEN DOM manipulation occurs THEN it SHALL use proper TypeScript DOM types
4. WHEN Chrome extension APIs are used THEN they SHALL have proper type definitions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to properly handle the modular TypeScript content script, so that it can be bundled and deployed correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript files are built THEN they SHALL be properly bundled into a single content script file
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing Chrome extension manifest
3. WHEN the bundled script is generated THEN it SHALL work in the content script context with proper isolation
4. WHEN source maps are generated THEN they SHALL allow for proper debugging of the TypeScript source
