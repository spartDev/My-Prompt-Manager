# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to share their custom website configurations for My Prompt Manager with other users. When a user configures a new AI platform through the settings view, they can generate an encoded configuration string that other users can import to replicate the same custom site setup in their Chrome extension. This promotes community sharing of platform integrations and reduces setup friction for new custom sites.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has configured a custom AI platform, I want to export my configuration as a shareable code, so that I can easily share it with other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am viewing a custom site configuration in the settings THEN the system SHALL display an "Export Configuration" button
2. WHEN I click the "Export Configuration" button THEN the system SHALL generate an encoded string representing the configuration
3. WHEN the encoded string is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically copy it to my clipboard
4. WHEN the configuration is copied THEN the system SHALL display a success notification confirming the copy action
5. IF the configuration contains sensitive data THEN the system SHALL exclude or sanitize sensitive information before encoding

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who receives a shared configuration code, I want to import it into my extension, so that I can quickly set up the same custom AI platform without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in the custom site management section THEN the system SHALL display an "Import Configuration" button or input field
2. WHEN I paste or enter an encoded configuration string THEN the system SHALL validate the format and decode the configuration
3. IF the configuration is valid THEN the system SHALL preview the configuration details before importing
4. WHEN I confirm the import THEN the system SHALL add the custom site configuration to my settings
5. IF a configuration with the same site already exists THEN the system SHALL prompt me to overwrite or create a duplicate
6. IF the encoded string is invalid or corrupted THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user importing a configuration, I want to see what will be configured before confirming, so that I can verify the settings are appropriate for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I paste a valid configuration code THEN the system SHALL display a preview showing the site name, URL patterns, and integration settings
2. WHEN viewing the preview THEN the system SHALL show which selectors and platform-specific settings will be applied
3. WHEN in preview mode THEN the system SHALL provide "Confirm Import" and "Cancel" options
4. IF the configuration includes custom CSS or JavaScript THEN the system SHALL clearly highlight these security-sensitive elements
5. WHEN I confirm the import THEN the system SHALL apply the configuration and show a success message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer sharing configurations, I want the encoded format to be compact and reliable, so that it can be easily shared through various communication channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating an encoded configuration THEN the system SHALL use a URL-safe encoding format
2. WHEN encoding the configuration THEN the system SHALL compress the data to minimize string length
3. WHEN decoding a configuration THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and handle version compatibility
4. IF the configuration format changes in future versions THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with older encoded strings
5. WHEN encoding fails due to data size or format issues THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to ensure that shared configurations cannot compromise my browser security, so that I can safely import configurations from other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing a configuration THEN the system SHALL sanitize all user-provided content using DOMPurify
2. WHEN processing custom selectors THEN the system SHALL validate that they contain only safe CSS selector syntax
3. IF a configuration contains potentially dangerous content THEN the system SHALL warn the user and require explicit confirmation
4. WHEN applying imported configurations THEN the system SHALL use the same security measures as manually created configurations
5. IF malicious content is detected THEN the system SHALL reject the import and log the security violation
