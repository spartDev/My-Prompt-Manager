# Chrome Extension Prompt Library - Testing Guide

This document outlines the testing procedures for verifying all requirements and ensuring data persistence across browser sessions and extension updates.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Build the Extension**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. Create 2-3 test prompts with different categories
3. Close the browser completely
4. Restart the browser
5. Open the extension popup
6. **Expected:** All created prompts should be visible

### Test 2: Extension Update Persistence
**Objective:** Verify data survives extension updates

**Steps:**
1. Create several test prompts
2. Make a minor change to the code
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
5. Open the extension popup
6. **Expected:** All existing prompts should remain intact

### Test 3: Storage Recovery
**Objective:** Test data corruption recovery

**Steps:**
1. Create test data
2. Open Chrome DevTools for the extension popup
3. Go to Application tab > Storage > Local Storage
4. Manually corrupt some data entries
5. Reload the extension
6. **Expected:** Extension should handle errors gracefully
